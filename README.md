Full Stack Milestone Project 4 - Code Institute

# JW Photography 

This is my fourth Milestone project of the Full Stack Frameworks with Django module from Code Institute. This project was designed to demonstrate all the knowledge and skills I have developed throughout the Code Institute Fullstack Web Developer course. This project will pull together the HTMl, CSS, JavaScript and Python skills learnt in previous modules and add using Django 3 to develop an e-commerce website.

## Project Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to allow a user to navigate across the different pages within a visually appealing and user friendly website and purchase photo products. This pulls together all skills that have been learnt throughout the Code Insitute course. The project is an e-commerce website that has the purpose of displaying products for the user to browse, add to a shopping cart and purchase. In addition to this were two custom models for the project which were used in the blog section where users can add comments to a blog and use the contact page to send a message to the Superuser admin panel.

This website would provide value to a user as it provides a number of different style photos available to purchase and enjoy. There is also a blog section to learn a little bit more about the website owners and about certain photos.

## UX

The user is able to peruse all available products in the gallery page, this could be achieved by viewing all products as initially displayed, filerting by price/rating/category, or selecting the a specific category of interest. A user has the ability to register as a user, or login if a previous account has been created, and then add items to a bag and  proceed to checkout to make the purchase.

User's also have the ability to use the contact page to send a message to the admin panel, or to view the blog page to read, comment and like various blog posts, as long as they are logged in.

## Colour Scheme



### Wireframes

I decided to use handrawn wireframes for this project, as there is a lot on features on certain pages which would be easier to reflect by hand. For the most part the wireframes match up with the final product, with the exception of the introduction to pagination and an alteration to the product details pages, which were introduced during the production process.

## Features

The 'CRUD' operations are featured throughout the website as it is possible for Superusers to create, read, update and delete product and blog data. The app also uses Django's register/login/logout feature for ease of use in creating new profiles.


### Existing Features:

* **Navbar** - On all devices the navbar has a brand logo in the top left hand corner which takes the user to the home page. The navigational links are contained within a burger menu on tablet and mobile devices in the top right hand corner. Rather than these links dropping down in a vertial list as is the norm, on tablet the 6 navigational links are displayed in a row, and on mobile they are displayed as two rows of three as this looks clear and appealing for the user. There is a search bar which is used to search for names or descriptions of products in the Gallery page. This search bar is displayed next to the brand logo on desktop, and on tablet and mobile is displayed central and below the brand logo and burger menu. There is also a link to the user's cart, which is presented with a cart logo and a number demonstrating the current value added to the cart, starting at Â£0.00.
-- The Account button in the navbar will display differently depending on the user's log in status. If a user is not logged in the Account button will drop down to provide the user the option to regiser or log in. If a user is logged in, the Account button will change from 'Account' to the user's username. The button will also dropdown with an option to view their profile or log out. If a Superuser is logged in, the Account dropdown will also include Product Management and Blog management, in which new products or blog posts can be added to the site.

* **Messages** - When a user makes various actions, or actions fail to execute a message appears at the top right corner of the screen.

* **Register** - When a user clicks the Account dropdown and selects register, they are presented with a form to fill out. They have to fill in their email address two separate times, ensuring they match, a username, and a password twice, again ensuring they match.

* **Log in** - When the user clicks the Account dropdown and selects log in, they have to fill in a form with a recognised username and associated password.

* **Log out** - When a user is already logged in and clicks the Account dropdown link, they can click sign out, and then have to confirm this action on a new page.

* **Blog Comments** - On each individual blog post, provided a user is logged in they are able to add a comment. Clicking the add comment button takes them to a form on a separate page, and then after filling in a comment and submitting it they are redirected to the post with the comment below. 
-- If a user is not logged in and tries to add a comment they are directed to the log in page, as a user needs to be logged in for this feature. Once a user has added a comment, their comment will be displayed with an option to delete the comment. This only appears next to comments created by that user.

* **Blog Likes** - On each individual blog post, provided a user is logged in they are able to like it by clicking the like button. This will change the blue 'like' button to a red 'unlike' button if they wish to reverse this decision. Each additional is displayed as a total number next to the like button.
-- If a user is not logged in and tries to add a comment they are directed to the log in page, as a user needs to be logged in for this feature.

* **Pagination** - The Blogs page uses a pagination feature, only displaying 4 blog posts on a single page. If there are additional blog posts a next button is available to click. After clicking the next button, there is then an option to click previous to return to the previous page, or next again if there are additional pages. In the middle of the next and previous buttons is a box highlighting how many pages there are in total and what page number the user is on.

* **Superuser** - If a user is logged in as a Superuser they will have a different display to regular users. On the Account button they have access to the Product and Blog Management pages. They also have access to the CRUD operations on the blog, blog details, gallery and gallery details pages to update and delete blog posts or products from the store.

* **Contact**  - The contact page has a simple contact form, the user is required to fill in each field. Once submitted the user is redirected to the home page, a confirmation message appears in the top corner of the screen. This message is then saved in the admin panel.

* **Gallery**: - All Products - On the gallery page there is a All Products dropdown link which gives the user to filter the total number of products by price/rating or category
            - On the gallery page there is a link for each category which once selected displays products solely from the category selected.

* **Frame Colour** - A simple frame colour selector on the product details page allows the user to see what the selected photo product would look like with different coloured frames

### Additional features to be implemented:

* I would like to enable the search bar in the navbar to search for data in the blog page as well as the products page
* I would like to add a functional email system in which the user receives an actual email confirmation after registering
* I would like to add a functional email system where a buisness email could receive emails submitted from the contact form
